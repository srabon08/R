There are many functions and operators that are useful when constructing the expressions used to filter the data

==, >, >= etc

&, |, !, xor()

is.na()

between(), near()

> Filtering by one criterion

* by Exact variable
  
```js
starwars_n <- starwars %>% 
  filter(species == "Human")
view(starwars_n)
```
#

* by starts with specific letter/ word

  ```js
  presidential_n <- presidential %>%
           filter(str_starts(name, "p"))
         print(presidential_n)
  ```
#
  
* by ends with specific letter/ word

  ```js
  presidential_n <- presidential %>%
           filter(str_ends(name, "p"))
         print(presidential_n)
  ```
#

* by contains specificletter/ word

#

* by starts with specific date


#
  
* by starts with specific date range

#

* By specific value

  ```js
  starwars_n <- starwars %>% 
  filter(mass > 1000)
  view(starwars_n)
  ```

--- 
> Filter by value and and remove 'NA' from the filtered column

```js
starwars_n <- starwars %>% 
  filter(mass > mean(mass, 
                     na.rm = TRUE))
view(starwars_n)
```

---

> Filtering by multiple criteria within a single logical expression

* AND function

```js
starwars_n <- starwars %>% 
group_by(gender) %>%
filter(hair_color == "none", eye_color == "black")
```

OR

```js
starwars_n <- starwars %>% 
group_by(gender) %>%
filter(hair_color == "none" & eye_color == "black")
```

#

* OR funtion

```js
starwars_n <- starwars %>% 
group_by(gender) %>%
filter(hair_color == "none" | eye_color == "black")
```
---

>  Group by gender and Filter by value and remove 'NA' from the filtered column

```js
starwars_n <- starwars %>% 
group_by(gender) %>%
filter(mass > mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Note: 
The filtering operation may yield different results on grouped tibbles because the expressions are computed within groups.

i.e. The following filters rows where `mass` is greater than the global average:

```js
starwars_n <- starwars %>% 
filter(mass > mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Whereas this keeps rows with `mass` greater than the gender average:

```js
starwars_n <- starwars %>% 
group_by(gender) %>%
filter(mass > mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))
```

> To refer to column names that are stored as strings, use the `.data` pronoun:

vars <- c("mass", "height")
cond <- c(80, 150)
starwars %>%
  filter(
    .data[[vars[[1]]]] > cond[[1]],
    .data[[vars[[2]]]] > cond[[2]]
  )


> Filter missing values

Which Starwars characters have/donâ€™t have missing values (NA) in hair_color?
