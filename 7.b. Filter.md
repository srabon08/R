There are many functions and operators that are useful when constructing the expressions used to filter the data:

==, >, >= etc

&, |, !, xor()

is.na()

between(), near()



filter(.data, ..., .by = NULL, .preserve = FALSE)


presidential_n <- presidential %>%
           filter(str_starts(name, "C")) #case sensitive
         print(presidential_n)



presidential_n <- presidential %>%
           filter(str_ends(name, "p"))
         print(presidential_n)


starwars %>% filter(mass > mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))
         

starwars %>% group_by(gender) %>% filter(mass > mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))


# Filtering by one criterion
filter(starwars, species == "Human")
filter(starwars, mass > 1000)

# Filtering by multiple criteria within a single logical expression
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none" & eye_color == "black")
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none" | eye_color == "black")

# When multiple expressions are used, they are combined using &
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none", eye_color == "black")


# The filtering operation may yield different results on grouped
# tibbles because the expressions are computed within groups.
#
# The following filters rows where `mass` is greater than the
# global average:
starwars %>% filter(mass > mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))

# Whereas this keeps rows with `mass` greater than the gender
# average:
starwars %>% group_by(gender) %>% filter(mass > mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))


# To refer to column names that are stored as strings, use the `.data` pronoun:
vars <- c("mass", "height")
cond <- c(80, 150)
starwars %>%
  filter(
    .data[[vars[[1]]]] > cond[[1]],
    .data[[vars[[2]]]] > cond[[2]]
  )

Filter missing values
Which Starwars characters have/donâ€™t have missing values (NA) in hair_color?
