> **Style Guide**

* Strive to limit code to `80` characters per line.
* Always **comment code**. Use comment symbol: `# + a single space`.
* File names should be meaningful and end in `.R`. Use a dash to separate words within a name i.e. `fit-models.R`
  ##### Tips: Always assign unique name to data frame to avoid confusion: `unique_name<- mpg`. 
* If files need to be run in sequence, prefix them with numbers i.e. `0-download.R`; `1-parse.R`
* Variable and function names should be lowercase. Use an underscore: `_` , to separate words within a name: `day_one`; `day_1`
* Where possible, avoid using names of existing functions and variables.
* Place spaces around all infix operators i.e. `=, +, -, <-` :
  ``` js
  x <- 1:10; average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)
  ```
* There’s a small exception to the spacing rule. The following `:, ::, :::` do not need spaces around them:
  ``` js
  y <- c(1:10)base::get
  ```
* Place a space before left parentheses, except in a function call:
  ``` js
  if (debug) do(x); plot(x, y)
  ```
* Space not needed in function call:
  ``` js
  plot (x, y)
  ```
* Extra spacing (i.e., more than one space in a row) is ok if it improves alignment of equal signs or assignments: 
``` js
list(
  total = a + b + c,
  mean = (a + b + c) / n
)
```
#  
* Do not put spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets (unless there’s a comma, in which case see above):
``` js
if (debug) do(x)
diamonds[5, ]
```
* An opening curly brace should never go on its own line and should always be followed by a new line+
A closing curly brace should always go on its own line, unless it’s followed by else+  
* Always indent the code, 2 spaces, inside curly braces:
``` js
if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message(“Y is negative”)
}
if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} else {
  y ^ x
}
```
#  
* It’s ok to leave very short statements on the same line:
``` js
if (y < 0 && debug) message(“Y is negative”)
```
* When indenting your code, `use two spaces`. Never use tabs or mix tabs and spaces.  
The only exception is if a function definition runs over multiple lines.  
In that case, indent the second line to where the definition starts:
``` js  
long_function_name <- function(a = “a long argument”,
                            b = “another argument”,
                            c = “another long argument”) {
```
