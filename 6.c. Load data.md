### Read data

#### Excel: Use any of the following depending on file type

> Note: Always assign a name to the dataframe [i.e. df <- read.csv(file.csv)]

``` js
df <- read.csv(“type_filename_here”) # Importing csv file`
```
OR
``` js
df <- read.csv(“type_filename_here.csv”) # Importing csv file 
```
OR
``` js
df <- read_excel(“type_filename_here.xls”) # To import xls files 
```
OR
``` js
df <- read_excel(“type_filename_here.xlsx”) # To import xlsx files 
```
OR
``` js
df <- read_excel(“type_filename_here”, sheet = 2) # To import an xls file stored in a particular sheet number (for example, sheet number 2)
```
OR
``` js
df <- read_excel(“type_filename_here”, sheet = students) # To import an xlsx file stored in a particular sheet name (for example, sheet named students)
```

#

#### Load data from R data file

```js
load(“type_filename_here.RData”) # read R data files` 
```
#### Load data from R packages

```js
load(file
```js
library(ggplot2) #load ggplot2 library
ls(package:ggplot2) #list all packages under ggplot2
mpg #load mpg dataset from ggplot2 package/make sure library is loaded
view(mpg) # To open the dataset/Table in a separate page in tabular format
```
OR 
```js
data() # opens a tab/window listing all the built-in datasets
data(package= "ggplot2") # opens a tab/window listing all avaialable datasets in ggplot2 package
data("mtcars") # load specific dataset i.e. mtcars dataset
```
OR

```js
load ("data_name.RData") #importing R data files. Prior to loading, clear all objects currently within the workspace to avoid overwrite.
```
