 ### Good to Know:

* In the examples below the `tidyverse` library has been used. Install the package if needed using:

  ```js
  install.package("tidyverse")
  ```
  
 * In the examples below: df = data frame; n = new; sm = small
   
 * print() function will print the whole dataset. For large dataset if you're   interested in having an overview only, instead of using head(), use any of the following:
   *  view()
   *  print()
   *  tail()
   *  str()
   *  glimpse()

library(tidyverse) # Load tidyverse library
```

#

* To load mtcars dataset
   
```js

### Use of Select()

#### Syntax of select():

```js
df_n <- select (df, variables_to_select)
```
OR 

```js
df_n <- df %>%
select(variables_to_select)
```
---

#### Examples: 

> Select specific column(s)

```js
mtcars_n <- mtcars %>% 
select (mpg, cyl, hp)
head (mtcars_n)
```

#

> Select all except specific column(s)

 ```js
mtcars_n <- mtcars %>%
select(-mpg, -cyl, -hp) # or, select(-c(mpg, cyl, hp); select(-(mpg, cyl, hp)
head (mtcars_n)
```

#

> Select columns by list of index or position

```js
mtcars_n <- mtcars %>%
select(c(2,3)) # or, select(2,3)
head (mtcars_n)
```

#

> Select columns by index range

```js
mtcars_n <- mtcars %>%
select(1:3)
head (mtcars_n)
```

#

> Select all except specific column by index range

```js
mtcars_n <- mtcars %>%
select(-(1:3)) # or, select(-c(1:3))
print (mtcars_n)
```

#

> Select columns between columns range identified by column id

```js
mtcars_n <- mtcars %>%
select(mpg:hp) # or, select('mpg':'hp')
head (mtcars_n)
```

#

> Select by column types: 

* numeric data: Will select `int: integer`, `dbl: double`, `cplx: complex` data.

```js
air_qual_n <- airquality %>%
select_if(is.numeric) 
head (air_qual_n)
```

  * Inter data:
   
```js
air_qual_n <- airquality %>%
select_if(is.integer) 
head (air_qual_n)
```

* Double data:
   
```js
air_qual_n <- airquality %>%
select_if(is.double) 
head (air_qual_n)
```

* Character data

```js
presidential_n <- presidential %>%
select_if(is.character) 
head (presidential_n)
```

* Date data

```js
presidential_n <- presidential %>%
select_if(is.Date) 
head (presidential_n)
```

#

> Select columns by string

* Starts with a letter

```js
select(starts_with("e") # not case sensitive
```

* Starts with a word

```js
select(starts_with("sale") 
```

> Select columns by string

* Ends with a letter

```js
select(ends_with("e") # not case sensitive
```

* Starts with a word

```js
select(ends_with("sale") 
```
*  Contains a specific letter
  
```js
select(contains('a'))
```

*  Contains a specific word
  
```js
select(contains('apple'))
```
